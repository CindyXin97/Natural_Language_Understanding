# Natural_Language_Understanding
This is a high level machine learning and deep learning courses which we specially focused on how to understand human language by using different models

## Preview:
The course is centered on text rather than speech, but within that, it will touch on the full range of applicable techniques for language understanding, including formal logics, statistical methods, distributional methods, and deep learning, and will bring in ideas from formal linguistics where they can be readily used in practice. We’ll discuss tasks like sentiment analysis, word similarity, and question answering, as well as higher level issues like how to effectively represent language meaning.
